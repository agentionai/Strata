# Gyro (agentionai rotor quants) on Strata

Validated on Linux with an RTX 5090 (32 GB, CUDA 13.0, sm_120; 2026-10-02 and 2026-10-03), an RTX 3090 (24 GB,
sm_86; 2026-10-03) and two RTX 4090s (24 GB each, sm_89; 2026-10-04, single and dual GPU). A short end-to-end run on AMD (Strix Halo, gfx1151, ROCm) passed on 2026-10-03.

The targets are the published files of `agentionai/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-Gyro-GGUF`, used unchanged:

| File | Experts | GPU memory for the experts | Status |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-Gyro-S-TQ1_0.gguf` (58.5 GB) | TQK6 gate/up, TQK7 down, block-128 Hadamard | 24.0 GiB | validated end to end (RTX 5090, RTX 3090) |
| `Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-Gyro-M-TQ2_0.gguf` (92.0 GB) | TQ2_T, block-128 Hadamard | 29.9 GiB | validated end to end (RTX 5090, RTX 3090); the experts do not all fit a 32 GB card, `auto` streams the rest |

Both files carry their own experts in the trellis types TQ2_T/TQK6/TQK7 and record the activation rotation in
`prism.hadamard.*` metadata. Strata reads both natively. About half of each file is the
n-gram (PLE) table, which stays on disk and is read row by row; it is not loaded into RAM or VRAM.

The draft head is Strata's own MTP runtime, prepared from the original model's MTP weights as for the other
Qwen3.8-Flash-Next models. It is not the GGUF draft file from the Gyro repository.

## Quick setup

Gyro support lives on the `rc2` branch of the agentionai Strata fork: Strata v0.1.40.3 plus the trellis types
(TQ2_T / TQK6 / TQK7), the Hadamard rotation and the CPU trellis kernels.

```sh
git clone -b rc2 https://github.com/agentionai/Strata
cd Strata
```

`tools/gyro_setup.sh` does every step below on Linux:

```sh
tools/gyro_setup.sh --model S --backend cuda --cuda-arch 120       # RTX 50 series
tools/gyro_setup.sh --model S --backend cuda --cuda-arch 89        # RTX 40 series
tools/gyro_setup.sh --model S --backend cuda --cuda-arch 86        # RTX 30 series / RTX A6000
tools/gyro_setup.sh --model S --backend hip  --hip-arch gfx1201    # Radeon RX 9070 / AI PRO R9700 (experimental)
```

It prints the command that starts the server. The steps, by hand:

## 1. Build

From the `rc2` checkout above. Strata's GGML dependency must be the agentionai llama.cpp fork, which has the trellis types:

```sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/agentionai/llama.cpp ../agention-llama.cpp
# NVIDIA. RTX 50 series: use CUDA 13 (CUDA 12.8 crashes the prompt path on sm_120: issues #220, #224)
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DSTRATA_ENABLE_CUDA=ON \
  -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=120 -DSTRATA_GGML_DIR=$PWD/../agention-llama.cpp
# AMD (experimental: kernel parity and an end-to-end run validated on gfx1151; in a non-root container add
# --group-add $(getent group render | cut -d: -f3), otherwise HIP finds no device)
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DSTRATA_ENABLE_HIP=ON -DSTRATA_PREFILL_MMQ=ON \
  -DCMAKE_HIP_ARCHITECTURES=gfx1201 -DSTRATA_GGML_DIR=$PWD/../agention-llama.cpp
cmake --build build -j
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 2. Download and pack

```sh
.venv/bin/pip install huggingface_hub hf_transfer
HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER=1 .venv/bin/hf download agentionai/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-Gyro-GGUF \
  Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-Gyro-S-TQ1_0.gguf --local-dir models
STRATA_GGUF_PY=../agention-llama.cpp/gguf-py .venv/bin/python tools/iq_pack.py \
  --gguf models/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-Gyro-S-TQ1_0.gguf --out packs/gyro-s --compat-bf16
build/native_expert_parity --load-check packs/gyro-s models/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-Gyro-S-TQ1_0.gguf
```

The pack is 1.5 GB (dense weights, tokenizer, the Hadamard and expert tables); the experts are read from the
GGUF. Keep the GGUF on a fast local SSD: the n-gram table is read from it for every token.
`--load-check` must end with `0 failures`.

## 3. Draft head

```sh
.venv/bin/python tools/mtp_fetch.py fetch --out mtp
.venv/bin/python tools/mtp_pack.py --src mtp --experts q2_0 --out mtp/mtp-q2_0.gguf
.venv/bin/python tools/mtp_rt.py --gguf mtp/mtp-q2_0.gguf --out mtp/rt
cp data/draft_vocab.bin mtp/rt/draft_vocab.bin
```

## 4. Serve

Save as `strata-gyro-s.json` at the repository root:

```json
{
  "exe": "build/strata",
  "args": [
    "--pack", "packs/gyro-s",
    "--native", "models/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-Gyro-S-TQ1_0.gguf",
    "--expert-profile", "data/expert-profile.bin", "--expert-cache", "auto",
    "--prefill", "auto", "--spec", "4", "--spec-min-p", "0.5",
    "--mtp", "mtp/rt", "--max-context", "131072", "--kv", "int8"
  ],
  "cwd": ".",
  "tokenizer": "packs/gyro-s/tokenizer",
  "model_name": "gyro-s-strata",
  "log": "strata-gyro-s.log",
  "host": "127.0.0.1",
  "port": 8080
}
```

```sh
.venv/bin/python -m serve.server --engine strata --config strata-gyro-s.json --port 8080
```

The web interface is at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`; API clients use `http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1` (OpenAI) or
`/v1/messages` (Anthropic). `--expert-cache auto` sizes the expert cache to the free VRAM: on a 32 GB card at
128k context it holds 23,464 of 24,576 experts (22.9 GiB). On smaller cards it holds fewer and streams the rest
from RAM; nothing else changes.

## Measured

All runs: greedy or the stated sampling, same prompt tokens as llama.cpp, MTP draft `--spec 4 --spec-min-p 0.5`,
int8 KV. "llama.cpp" is the agentionai fork with the CUDA trellis fixes (in its `main` since 2026-10-04).

### RTX 5090 (32 GB), Gyro-S, all experts on the GPU (2026-10-03)

Decode tokens/s, single prompts of 34-177 tokens, 384 new tokens, `--max-context 16384` (all 24,576 experts cached):

| | prose | JSON | code |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Strata | 139.9 | 221.3 | 209.0 |

Server, `tools/gyro_setup.sh` config (128k context, 23,463 experts cached), thinking off, temperature 0.7,
top-k 20, top-p 0.95, min-p 0.05, 512 new tokens, 3 repetitions:

| | prose | JSON | code | copy |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Strata | 131.7 | 200.1 | 195.2 | 201.8 |
| llama.cpp, MTP draft | 116.8 | 213.0 | 179.0 | 220.7 |
| llama.cpp, no draft | 121.8 | 123.2 | 122.5 | 121.2 |

Long real-text prompts, prefill tokens/s: 4k tokens 3,456 (llama.cpp 2,520), 16k tokens 4,883 (llama.cpp 2,471).

### RTX 5090, Gyro-M (2026-10-03)

The experts (29.9 GiB) do not all fit next to the KV cache; `auto` caches 18,007 of 24,576. Same server protocol:
prose 113.8, JSON 170.8, code 153.0, copy 175.7 tokens/s; prefill 4k 3,369, 16k 4,854 tokens/s. llama.cpp needs
`-ncmoe 8` for this file on a 32 GB card and decodes at 70.8 tokens/s without a draft.

### RTX 3090 (24 GB), 2026-10-03

Same server protocol, 128k context, `auto` cache:

| | experts cached | prose | JSON | code | copy | prefill 4k | prefill 16k |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Gyro-S | 15,756 | 31.8 | 45.2 | 42.2 | 45.1 | 1,402 | 1,863 |
| Gyro-M | 11,811 | 27.8 | 39.4 | 34.4 | 37.7 | 1,363 | 1,910 |
| llama.cpp, Gyro-S, `-ncmoe 10`, 32k context, no draft | (10 layers on the CPU) | 16.0 | 16.2 | 16.2 | 16.5 | 468 (`-ncmoe 11`) | 479 |

On a 24 GB card, cache misses run on the CPU, so the CPU matters: this box had a Zen 2 EPYC (AVX2, no AVX-512).
The llama.cpp row is the build before the CUDA trellis fixes; those added about 3 % at 24 GB, where the CPU layers
dominate.

The Strata rows predate Strata's own CPU kernels for the trellis types (`src/kernels/cpu/tq_*.cpp`, AVX2 and
AVX-512, picked at run time). Before them a cache miss ran ggml-cpu's `vec_dot`, one token at a time; the new kernels
take about 45 % of its time per expert on AVX2 and decode a block once for all the tokens of a verify window
(`build/tq_cpu_parity --bench` measures them on your CPU). `STRATA_NO_TQ_KERNELS=1` goes back to ggml-cpu;
`STRATA_TQ_ISA=avx2` or `scalar` caps the instruction set (for comparisons).

### Smaller caches (RTX 5090, 2026-10-02, before the int8 decode kernels)

| Expert cache | prose | JSON | code |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 24,576 slots (all experts) | 116.4 | 194.3 | 173.5 |
| 22,000 slots | 111.4 | 175.7 | 166.1 |
| 9,000 slots (about a 16 GB card's room) | 81.4 | 74.0 | 96.8 |
| 3,000 slots (about an 8 GB card's room) | 48.0 | 52.4 | 57.9 |

The smaller caches were emulated on the 5090 (fast GPU, PCIe 5.0 x16 at ~51 GB/s). A real 8 or 16 GB card is a
slower GPU, often on a slower link: read those rows as "it stays usable", not as a prediction for a specific card.
The decoded output was read and is fluent and correct; token-level parity against llama.cpp has not been
checked. A real chat at 128k context worked through the web interface.

### Two GPUs (2026-10-04, 2× RTX 4090, no NVLink/P2P)

- **Layer split** (Strata splits the layers across both cards automatically) works with Gyro, including the
  idle-card prompt helper (`STRATA_PREFILL_HELP=1`). Repeated runs give identical output.
- **Decode with a second card** (`--peer-device 1` or `--expert-cache-device1 auto`) works and matches single-GPU output.
- **Prompt processing on the peer card** needs GPU-to-GPU access (NVLink or data-centre GPUs); without it Strata keeps
  the prompt on the first GPU and logs `no P2P`.

Single RTX 4090 smoke run (Gyro-S, MTP draft, greedy): code 107.5, prose 84.3, JSON 76.3 tokens/s.

## Numerics

- **Decode** (Strata's own expert kernels) reads the trellis weights through an int8 copy of the codebook with one
  global scale (`tq_lut_i8`, relative RMS error 0.85 % of the codebook's standard deviation, far below the
  quantization error itself), against q8_1 activations.
- **Prompt processing** decodes them otherwise: the FP16 path through the fp16 codebook (`tq_lut_f16`, what GGML's
  own dequantizer reads); the MMQ path through the llama.cpp fork's kernels, which read the int8 codebook as well
  on the fork's current `main`.
- So decode and prompt results agree within tolerance, not bit for bit. `native_expert_parity` checks one expert
  on the decode kernels against GGML's float dequantizer and a float SwiGLU: relative L1 error below 3e-2, the
  bound every expert type gets there. Its "bitwise equal" lines compare Strata's decode-once and per-entry decode
  kernels with each other, not with a float reference.

## Known limits

- **Not measured yet:** token parity against llama.cpp.
- **Benchmark mode only:** `strata --tokens-file ... --max-new N` decodes N tokens past the end of the answer;
  compare speeds only up to the answer's end.
- **AMD:** the trellis kernels pass parity on gfx1151 (ROCm 7.2.1) and a short end-to-end run there generated
  correctly (~28-31 tokens/s); no speed tuning or RDNA4 run yet.
- **Gyro-M:** 29.9 GiB of experts do not all fit a 32 GB card next to the KV cache; `auto` streams the rest.
- **Not validated end to end yet** (Strata runs them and logs a warning): an AMD GPU other than gfx1151, and
  prompt processing on a peer GPU over P2P.
